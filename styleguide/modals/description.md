## Modals

Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults.

`$modal` is a service to quickly create AngularJS-powered modal windows. Creating custom modals is straightforward: create a partial view, its controller and reference them when using the service.
